        <h3>Obstacle Avoiding Robot</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to learn Arduino and implement
          the programming concepts to control different sensors and hardwares.
          This robot was made basically to avoid any obstacle in front of it.
          If any obstacle is detected by the ultrasonic sensor (attached on
          top of Servo motor) in its path it sends the signal to the
          microcontroller (Arduino Uno board). Which calculates the distance
          and controls the Servo motor to turn in a right and left direction
          to see the available path and moves accordingly.

        <h3>online Forum</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to make some platform where
          people can share there queries and knowledge with each other.
          It is an online platform where lots of people can gather and
          ask there query from any random user of the forum. It is designed
          in such a way that any non-register user can see the queries posted
           by other user but cannot post until he is
          registered .There is an admin section also who can monitor that no one abuses.
           And if so then he can delete the message or remove the user from the forum.
          Languages used are PHP,CSS, HTML, JavaScript and MySql.
